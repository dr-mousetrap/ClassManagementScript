# ClassManagementScript
A script to manage my classes in google sheets, because how tf else am i supposed to manage the sheer chaos of 16 classes.

It works off of a prebuilt google sheet which is at this link: (Link to be added)
As far as how to use it goes, the primary functions of the script are:

Z - Generates a dropdown in the box where the z is placed

X - Counts how many drop downs are above it until there is a break and then sets up the box to determine how 'complete' the assignment is.

C# - C plus any number will generate that numbers worth of drop downs before placing a completion box below.

V# - Completly clears all of the boxes listed within the number range (V5 clears itself plus the five boxes below it)

There is currently also a function that when a box is coloured purple and then updated to clear the box, this will be removed as I removed the need for this with the much faster V function.
