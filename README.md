# ClassManagementScript
A script to manage my classes in google sheets, because how tf else am i supposed to manage the sheer chaos of 16 classes


As far as how to use it goes, the primary functions of the script are:

Z - Generates a dropdown in the box where the z is placed
X - Counts how many drop downs are above it until there is a break and then sets up the box to determine how 'complete' the assignment is.
C# - C plus any number will generate that numbers worth of drop downs before placing a completion box below.
V# - Completly clears all of the boxes listed within the number range (V5 clears itself plus the five boxes below it)
